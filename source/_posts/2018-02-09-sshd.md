  title: Login to machine with root permission and password

## Needs 
For the TechOps, we use the ssh in our work everyday to login to the remote machines, and for some reasons, passing the rsa keys might be risky in some cases. And most importantly, I am so lazy setting up all the rsa environments for just a trail function. Thus, what I want to do is logging into the remote machine

- with root user
- with password

## Problems

And, often, when you set up your password for root and feel exciting to start your work, you are going to find this message: 

{% note danger %} 
MBP-de-XICUN:UltiSnips xicunhan$ ssh root@192.168.0.119
The authenticity of host '192.168.0.119 (192.168.0.119)' can't be established.
ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:Ie0c9FfmvITir9FT1KBv6R7qwa4dg2T1TQK5T/yDXyk.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes
Warning: Permanently added '192.168.0.119' (ECDSA) to the list of known hosts.
root@192.168.0.119's password: 
Permission denied, please try again.
{% endnote %} 

What is happening?? Running the ssh with **debug** information won't give you any hint.

## Solution

The fact is that, the ssh is configured to do not give permission for root access with password. **To make our machine more vulnerable willingly for our lazyness** what we should done is to :

- Edit the /etc/ssh/sshd_config adding the following lines:

> PasswordAuthentication yes

> PermitRootLogin yes

- Restart the service 

> systemctl restart ssh sshd
