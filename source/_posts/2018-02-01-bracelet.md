Recently, I want to buy myself a sliver bracelet which will fit exactly my wrist. This is a picture of what it looked like.

You are going to see that it is really hard to tell the thickness of this bracelet even if you got the circumference of your wrist. 

Here is what I have done to calculate it. 

{% note info %} 
**What I know:**

- The longer radius of my wrist: 5.7
- The shorter radius of my wrist: 4.1
- The density of silver is: 10.05 g/cm\*compact
- We are going to use 200g silver build this bracelet

{% endnote %} 


Thus, if we want to calculate the diameter of this bracelet:

Here I recommend a useful software : numi

Very easy to use, in several try, I got my final result: 1.14 cm


I back up this script for later use: 

~~~bash
x=0.57 = 0,57
a=2.85+x = 3,42
b=2.05+x = 2,62

c=(a-b)*4+2*3.14*b = 19,65

3.14*x*x*c*10.05 = 201,51
0.57*2 = 1,14
